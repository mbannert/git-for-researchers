## Git Gut Check

- use R
- passively use git
- actively use git

## Git Breakdown

- git is a version control system (for text files).
- git is decentralized.
- git is NOT github.

## Git +/- (vs no version control)

- (-) learning curve / overhead
- (-) not for binaries
- (+) industry standard (easy to onboard people)
- (+) semantic commits foster real versions
- (+) head is clear (which version counts)
- (+) professional collaboration workflow
- (+) distributed backup

## Git is decentralized

## A few words on Github

- github <3 remote git provider of most
- cool features:
    - issue tracker /w close commit
    - renders markdown
    - [renders geojson](https://github.com/mbannert/maps) 
    - project management
    - wiki
    
  - alternatives: bitbucket, gitlab
  - GUIs: Github Desktop, Source Tree, Tortoise

## Excursion: Log in like a developer

<img src="many_doors.jpg" width="400px" />

  - key pair: public and private key
  - share public key with the party you want to access
  - never share private key
  - private key can be password protected

# Let the games begin!

## Teams

- team *ten*
- team *jacks*
- team *queens*
- team *kings*
- team *aces*

spades are group admins.

## Git Gut Check Pt. II

- git clone
- git init
- git remote -v
- git add
- git commit
- git push 
- git pull origin
- git status
- git log
- git diff
- git branch
- git checkout
(- git bisect)


## Task 1: setup a repository

- admins: goto github and create a git repository
- admins: add your collaborators
- everybody: think of a good place on your hard disk to store multiple git projects
- everybody: get URL from github and clone repo

## Task 2: get an update

- admins: create a text file with minimal content
- admins: add, commit and push the file
- team members: get the latest update from the remote repository

helpul commands: git status, git remote -v

## Task 4: The first conflict

- everybody: create a file called your_name.md
- add some text to the file
- commit the file and add it to your teams repository
- does it work? What happens? 

## Task 5: conflicts that need manual intervention

- pick two team members.
- first member: create a file named *team.md*
- enter text to the first three lines
- add, commit, push it to the remote repo
- second member: create a file named *team.md*
- edit the first two lines.
- add, commit, push it to the remote repo

- What happens? What does git do to help you fix this?

## Task 3: Undo

- revert changes to single file
- revert commit

## Professional development workflow /w git

<img src="branches.png"/>

- **production** code on **master** branch
- **development** code on **dev** branch
- **feature specific** code on **feature-xyz** branch
- use **pull requests** and **revision requests** to get features to **dev**
- use **pull requests** and **revision requests** to get dev merged on **master**

hint: git log --graph --pretty=oneline

## Task 5: create a feature branch to tackle an issue

- admin: raise an issue using the issue tracker
- make sure you're up to date before working on the feature
- switch branches by checking out the new feature-branch
- add branches to the remote search path
- use the Github GUI to issue a PR
- team admin: approve review and merge

hint: use a commit message that refers to the issue by its number, like
**closes #2**.
